# Coursework for CMEE: Week 7

- **blackbirds&#46;py:** Outputting bird's kingdom, phylum and species from dataset using regular expression.

- **fmr.R:** Plots log(field metabolic rate) against log(body mass) for the Nagy et al 1999 dataset to a file fmr.pdf.

- **LV1&#46;py:** Fitting the Lotka-Volterra model and generating population dynamics graphs.

- **LV2&#46;py:** Fitting the Lotka-Volterra model and generating population dynamics graphs with input values from the command line.

- **NC&#46;py:** Script for numerical computing in Python.

- **profileme&#46;py:** Script for using Python profiling to find out what is slowing down the code.

- **profileme2&#46;py:** Script for using Python profiling to find out what is slowing down the code - Converted the loop to a list comprehension, replaced .join with an explicit string concatenation. 

- **Regular_expressions&#46;py:** Script for explaining regular expressions.

- **run_fmr_R&#46;py:** Runs fmr.R to generate the desired result and print to the python screen whether the run was successful, and the contents of the R console output..

- **run_LV&#46;py:** Runs both LV1.py and LV2.py with appropriate arguments.

- **timeitme&#46;py:** Using timeit to test loops vs. list comprehensions: which is faster? 

- **using_os.py:** Use the subprocess.os module to get a list of files and directories from a certain path with or without a given condition.

- **vectorization&#46;py:** Showing the difference in runtime between a loop method and a vectorized method using numpy.

- **workflow&#46;py:** Using Python to build workflows.
